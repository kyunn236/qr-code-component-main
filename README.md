## Overview

## My process

I started with identifying that I'm working with a card, which means its own DIV.

I analyzed that the card has 2 section, the image and the texts. Further, the texts have what seems to be a main text and a sub text. I then
coded the HTML accordingly.

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Although I knew how to do all of this, getting the box-shadow right was a bit hard. I think the difference is in the color
value/transparency that was used. That's why I didn't mess with mine too much. I tried to use the color palette that was given.

### Continued development

I want to fix the box shadow to more closely match the design. Also, I want to match the font-size and color of the subtext.
